Install Bucardo like any other Perl module:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Note that make test is a rather involved process and involves editing the 
t/bucardo.test.data file before beginning. However, because Bucardo 
is fairly complex, testing is highly recommended before installing.

It is recommended that you create a new user named bucardo on your system 
that will contain the Bucardo files.

Once the above has been run, you will need to create a Bucardo database. 
Create a superuser named "bucardo" and then create a database named 
"bucardo" owned by the same. Then, import the schema:

psql -U bucardo bucardo -f bucardo.schema

There should be no errors: if there are, please report them to 
bucardo-general@bucardo.org or ask on the main mailing list for help.

Bucardo by deafult logs to syslog, and does so very verbosely. It is 
recommended that you reroute your bucardo log traffic to another file. 
This can be done by adding this line to your /etc/syslog.conf file:

local1.*      -/var/log/bucardo.log

Of course, if "local1" is already being used for something else, you will 
need to change it - see the "syslog_facility" entry in the bucardo_config 
table.

Once this is done, make sure you restart your syslog daemon so it rereads the 
new configuration file.
