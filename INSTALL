Install Bucardo like any other Perl module:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

The last step must be done as root.

Note that 'make test' is a rather complex and long process.
However, because Bucardo is fairly complex, testing is highly 
recommended before installing.

It is recommended that you create a new user named 'bucardo' on your system 
that will contain the Bucardo files, or use the 'postgres' user.

Once the above has been run, you will need to create a Bucardo database. 
This can be done by running:

bucardo_ctl install

There should be no errors: if there are, please report them to 
bucardo-general@bucardo.org or ask on the main mailing list for help.

Bucardo by default logs to syslog, and does so very verbosely. It is 
recommended that you reroute your bucardo log traffic to another file. 
This can be done by adding this line to your /etc/syslog.conf file:

local1.*      -/var/log/bucardo.log

Of course, if "local1" is already being used for something else, you will 
need to change it - see the "syslog_facility" entry in the bucardo_config 
table.

Once this is done, make sure you restart your syslog daemon so it rereads the 
new configuration file.

Please see the documentation at http://bucardo.org for information on how to 
start using Bucardo once it is installed.
