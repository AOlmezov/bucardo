3.2.7 June 2009

New features:

  - Add support for multi-column primary keys. Thanks to Backcountry.com. [GSM]

  - Add new 'onetimecopy' attribute to sync table, to allow recreation on 
    demand of pushdelta tables on slaves via COPY. [GSM]

  - Add log_conflict_details to allow logging of conflict information 
    to a separate file. [Adam Wendt]

  - Add 'maxkicks' and 'lifetime' to syncs to force restart of controller 
    and kids after a certain number of kicks or time. [Josh Tolley]
    Thanks to Backcountry.com.

  - Add the bucardo_rate table to track exactly how long replication takes
    on a per-sync and per-table basis. [GSM]

  - Add more bucardo_ctl actions: reload, validate [GSM]

  - Add in bucardo_compress_delta function, to remove duplicate rows from 
    the bucardo_delta table. [GSM]

  - Allow the injection of custom messages into the Bucardo logs, and make 
    an interface for same in bucardo_ctl. [GSM]

  - Add the "warning_file" config parameter to log all 'Warning' messages. [GSM]

  - Add validate_all_syncs() function, and allow an argument to both that 
    and validate_sync() to force recreation of supporting objects. [GSM]

Enhancements:

  - Remove 'Moose' dependency. [GSM]

  - Remove disable_triggers and disable_rules from the sync table. 
    We simply choose pg_class or replica based on the version of the 
    database in question. [GSM]

  - Rewrite the pushdelta sync method to be more efficient and safer. [GSM]

  - Change from Mail::Sendmail to Net::SMTP [Ben Allen]

  - Allow wildcards in the 'bucardo_ctl kick' [Josh Tolley]

  - Improve the FreeBSD scripts/bucardo_ctl.rc file [Ben Allen]

  - Add "sendmail" option to the customcode input. [Ben Allen]

  - Add 'bucardo_ctl upgrade' to make intra-version upgrades easy 
    and automatic. [Selena Deckelmann and GSM]

  - Add more tests and improve existing ones. [Josh Tolley]

  - Make the audit_pid table more useful. Use sequences instead of 
    PIDs to find children. Allow for the audit_pid table to be toggled off. [GSM]

  - Remove the debugstderr and debugstdout options, as they never worked 
    correctly anyway. [GSM]

  - MCP listens for pings during table validations. [GSM]

  - Have master_q use a trigger, not multiple rules. Remove the need 
    for a separate create_child_q() function. [GSM]

  - Default for log_showtime is now 'scalar localtime' rather than 
    epoch seconds. [GSM]

Bug fixes:

  - Fix failure to disable/enable triggers when using pg_class and table 
    and schema are words changed by quote_ident. [Ben Allen]

  - Tolerate incompatibility in DEFAULT of negative numbers between 
    Postgres 8.2 and 8.3. [Jon Jensen]

  - Do better checking of bucardo_ctl executable when MCP is restarting. [Ben Allen]

  - Change timestamp to timestamptz where needed inside Bucardo.pm [Yan Farmawan]

  - Put schema in db_getconn calls [Alex Bahlai]

  - Record the proper PID for the MCP in the pid file [Goran Gugic]

  - Set the tcp_* defaults in bucardo_config to zero (system default). [GSM]

  - Allow for dead columns when checking attnums. [GSM]

  - Do not attempt respawn of MCP if mcp_dbproblem_sleep is 0. [GSM]

    for pushdelta syncs. [GSM]

  - Auto-detect primary keys (or unique indexes) for added tables. [GSM]

  - Add update_bucardo_schema.pl to faciliate version changes. [GSM]

  - Use correct quoted/non-quoted versions of primary keys to allow 
    primary keys with spaces, etc. [GSM]
