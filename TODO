TODO list for Bucardo
=====================

These range the gamut from wildly speculative ideas to must-have features.

- Death-level custom code hooks
- Better conflict example in test suite, uses database handles
- Allow adjustable criteria for going into lock before sync mode
- Make child_q creation more dynamic and not relying on cronjobs
- Use triggers, not rules, for master_q inheritance
- Make timeslices for master_q adjustable
- Allow more data types for pkey on goats
- Automatic detection of primary keys
- Allow goats to have multi-column primary keys
- Strip out large src_code from the email dumps
- Handle partitioned tables
- Allow notification emails to be regex sorted, e.g. serialization warnings
- Make bucardo_ctl use same algorithm as bucardo-report for grabbing sync history
- Have bucardo_ctl give details on KILLED syncs while kicking
- See also XXX and TODO inside Bucardo.pm
- Function or script to consolidate bucardo_delta entries for very asynchronous syncs
- Have a single table track current status of each sync/target combo. This would 
  allow the controller to do smarter things, and would make the reporting much faster
- Add a pause mode
- Add exception code for DELETE
- Less reliance on PID matching overall for some queries
- Purge or move audit_pid on startup
- Break logging into named levels
- Complain loudly on startup if a sync fails
- I8n all messages/docs/etc.
- Allow targets to be hard-linked: nobody goes on until everyone has finished
